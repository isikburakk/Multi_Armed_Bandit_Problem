## Definition of project

This project works on multi armed bandit problem. I used bayesian approach to multi armed bandit problem based on Beta
Bernoulli Model. In order to solve explore-exploit dilemma benefit from Thomson sampling, e-greedy method, upper confidence bounce sampling
two customized version of thomson sampling which are defined at evaluation.ipynb file.  You can find detailed work at evaluation.ipynb.
